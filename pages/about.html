                    <h1>
                        Newly available program helps South Africans to negotiate and reduce their debt level. Some
                        experience up to
                        60% decrease of their monthly repayments. Look at how much you could save today!

                            Important notice to all South Africans - check how much you could be saving with debt relief

                        <p class="my-7">Let's be honest, having Debt is not fun! The average South African has more than
                            $45,000
                            worth of short term loans and credit card debt alone, not including their home mortgage!
                            That number is
                            up by $1,000 from just one year ago! South Africans are on a dangerous path of acquiring
                            more debt than
                            they can handle. So, it's no surprise that people are using this new program to get out of
                            debt faster.
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-7"><a href="#">This newly approved program</a> could help you get
                            out of debt
                            and could lower the amount of money that you have to pay back to your creditors. If you have
                            credit card
                            debt, you should try to take advantage of this program ASAP.</p>
                        <p class="my-7">With millions of South Africans living paycheck to paycheck, the time for debt
                            relief has
                            never been more urgent. The short term lenders and credit card companies know this. And they
                            also know
                            that it's better to get something - rather than little or nothing - from consumers who
                            default on debts
                            or declare bankruptcy</p>

                        A Debt Relief Plan Is Like Found Money

                    <div class="my-12">
                        <p class="mb-7">Once you get started on a debt relief plan, you could find yourself paying less
                            every month
                            - and actually getting out of debt faster! How is this possible? When credit card companies
                            agree to
                            lower interest rates, waive late fees and penalties your payments go much further to get rid
                            of your
                            actual debt.</p>
                        <p class="my-7">By getting on a <a href="#">debt relief plan</a>, your credit
                            card
                            balances shrink month after month and before you know it, you're out of debt.</p>
                        <p class="my-7">Can you imagine what <a href="#">being debt free</a> is like?
                            They say
                            money doesn't buy happiness, but from all reports, being debt free allows people to live
                            better lives.
                            For example, couples who have no debt argue less, and can do more fun things with their
                            money.</p>
                        <p class="my-7">Would you like to be one of them? Then <a href="#">take five

                            bit. And it
                            could save you thousands.</p>
